Notes on the statistics associated with characters that affect combat
effectiveness

## Attributes and pools

**Pools** are transient resources associated with a character. Each
  pool has an equilibrium point to which it always tends to naturally
  return. When a character uses an action, the action affects the
  level of one or more pools. Depending on the nature of the pool and
  the action, it may raise or lower the level of the pool. When no
  actions are taking place, the pool tends to return to its
  equilibrium, more quickly if the character is not in combat.

**Attributes** are permanent statistics attached to a character that
  determine the size of each pool, its equilibrium point, and its
  return of return to equilibrium.

## Pools

**Power:** Direct-damage attacks draw from the Power pool. Generally
speaking, attacks that draw more Power have a stronger effect and
greater range.

- determining attribute: **Potential**

**Availability:** Quick-movement and quick-action abilities draw from the
  Availability pool. Generally speaking, abilities that draw more energy
  move more quickly and have greater chance of success. Teleports,
  bilocations, and illusions all draw from Energy.

- determining attribute: **Bandwidth**

**Cooling:** Defensive abilities that resist and absorb damage draw
  from the Cooling pool. The more damage that is absorbed or
  neutralized, the more Dissipation is depleted. Most abilities
  generate **heat** as a byproduct; all heat generated depletes the
  Cooling pool. Heat that is generated or absorbed from outside when
  the Cooling pool is empty instead depletes the Integrity pool, and
  can ultimately kill the character.

- determining attribute: **Capacity**

**Cycles:** Defensive and utility abilities that control or repair
  draw from the Cycles pool. Examples are repair, mind-control, and
  minion-control abilities.

- determining attribute: **Throughput**

**Integrity:** Integrity measures the ability of a character to
  continue functioning. Direct damage to a character draws from the
  character's Integrity pool. It is the health meter of a Fabric
  character. At Integrity zero the character is effectively dead and
  must respawn a backup at a designated archive.

- determining attribute: **Robustness**
