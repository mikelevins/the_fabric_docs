Scenario: leveling a new Caretaker character

I. Character creation

1. Choose "Create a Caretaker"

2. Choose a starting class: Botnet
   The Botnet is a class that gives you ways to seed minion packages
   across computing nodes that you encounter and then later quickly
   recruit those nodes to work for you. Recruited nodes will quickly
   defend themselves and cut off your zombie minions, but you can
   nevertheless quickly muster tremendous--if brief--bursts of
   power.

3. Accept a starting class quest
   The class quest, supplied by the Botnet manufacturer,
   gives you a set of goals that require you to exercise each
   of the base skills of the Botnet class. Completing all goals
   unlocks the first tier of enhanced Botnet skills and gains
   you access to quests to learn a hadful of other classes.
   You must choose on of these quest lines to get your
   second class unlocked.

4. Accept a quest to visit a few easily-accessible nodes.

5. Accept a quest to establish relations with all three major
   NPC factions; this quest will require you to choose bad
   relations with at least one faction.
