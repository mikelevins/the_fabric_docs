Classes are bundles of skill unlocks, each based on a small number of
related mechanics and resources. We'' divide the available classes
into a set of archetypes, related to the common patterns found in
MMORPGs.

I. Tank 
   A. Load Balancer
      High compute capacity and bandwidth enable the Load Balancer to
      weather heavy attacks and keep pumping out attacks of its own.

II. Healer
   A. Hotplug 
      The Hotplug provides retargetable compute capacity that can
      be assigned to supplement a target unit, restoring capacity
      that has been rendered inoprtable by attacks

III. Rogue
   A. Trojan
      The Trojan disguises itself as an innocuous service, but when it
      gains access to a target, spawns attack minions inside the
      target's defenses. 

IV. Mage
   A. 
      

V. Ranger
   A. Harrier
      The Harrier directs one or two robust minions to engage its target
      with direct attacks, then peppers the target with rapid attack messages
      from a more distant node, relying on the minions to obscure
      the Harrier's location and run interference while its messages wear down the 
      target.

VI. Shapeshifter
   A. Chameleon
      The Chameleon carries a handful of different attack profiles
      resembling other archetypes. It can quickly shhift from one to
      another. It opens with one, and if it meets a successful
      resistance, shifts to another. Because it devotes resources to
      multiple attack profiles, each one cannot have the same depth of
      resources or strategies that a single-profile class can.

VII. Summoner
   A. Botnet
      The Botnet can rapidly recruit resources from many nodes that
      it has previously seeded to instantly create zombie networks of
      minions. These nets are temporary, lasting only until the
      compromised hosts repair themselves, but can nevertheless produce
      brief bursts of tremendouns power.

VIII. Engineer
