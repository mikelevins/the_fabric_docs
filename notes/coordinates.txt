A coordinate system for Solaria

the diameter of solar system including the Kuiper Belt is roughly 100 AU.

1AU = 149,597,871 km
    = 149,597,871,000 m

So 100 AU is roughly 14,959,787,100,000 m

Making a small adjustment in order to obtain convenient quotients, we'll set Solaria's diameter to:

  +solaria-diameter-in-meters+ = 14,862,734,272,440

I want to use a single fixnum to count major grid lines in the
coordinate system. The count of gridlines must therefore be less than
or equal to most-positive-fixnum. In Lispworks, most-positive-fixnum
is 536870911.

Furthermore, I want a major gridline exactly on the origin, which is
the center of the sun, and I want the edge of the disk to be at a
whole number of major gridlines out from the center, for convenience
in computing graphics. So, in order to give us a whole number quotient
when dividing by two, I'll set the maximum coordinate value to (-
most-positive-fixnum 1):

  +maximum-coordinate-value+ = (- most-positive-fixnum 1) = 536,870,910 

Each gridline marks a discrete distance from the center of the
sun. Since there are +maximum-coordinate-value+ of them from one side
of the solar system to the other, the unit of distance represented by
the scale of the grid is:

  (/ +solaria-diameter-in-meters+ +maximum-coordinate-value+)
  = 27,684 m

We will dub this unit of distance a Solar League:

  1 Solar League (or sol) = 27,684 meters

The diameter of the solar system is by definition 536,870,910 solar
leagues.

The radius of the solar system is by definition 268,435,455 solar
leagues.

A coordinate built on single-fixnum coordinates gives us a resolution
of 1 sol--a resolution of about 28 km. For navigation on surfaces of
planets and smaller bodies, we want a higher resolution.

By subdividing a sol into 1 million microsols, we obtain a resolution
of 0.027684 m, or 27.684 millimeters--roughly 1 1/32 inch.

Dividing 1 microsol into one million picosols, we get a resolution of
27.684 micrometers.
